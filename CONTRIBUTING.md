# Contributing Guidelines üõ†Ô∏è
Thanks for your interest in contributing to `Authfix`!

## Reporting Bugs
- Feel free to open an [issue][issues].

## Provide PR
1. Fork the repository and create a new branch for your feature or fix.
    - New features should first be discussed in the Idea section of [Discussions][discussions]
2. Make your changes with clear, readable code.
3. Please provide a test case for your modification, unless it's trivial.
4. Format your code using `rustfmt` before committing.
5. Write a clear commit message explaining your change. It would be nice, if it includes a semantic prefix, such as:
    - [+] Introduce a complete new feature
    - [-] Remove a feature completely
    - [FIX] Fix a bug
    - [*] Any other change to the production code
    - [DOC] Add documentation
    - [TEST] Change, fix or add tests
    - [REF] Refactoring
6. Open a pull request with a brief description of what you‚Äôve done.
